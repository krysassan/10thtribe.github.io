      <h3>Taking Dany Pen’s Pulse</h3>  
      <h4> from Toronto’s Regent Park Projects to Bermuda’s Biennale</h4>

    <article>
      A little after high noon, Dany Pen and I tuck away to Maria’s Ristorante: Chancery Lane’s discreet, cobblestone meeting place for politicians and businessmen. We are neither. Cambodian, Canadian, “‘hood:” Ms. Pen is all of these things. She is full, red lips and a leopard skin sweater, huge gold hoops and fine art. Dany has taken a break from her job coordinating the National Gallery’s youth education program to talk with me about how she has come to be an expat, an immigrant, and an artist; how she came to create art that through merges her personal histories of genocide, poverty, and displacement. Most importantly, I want to know how she came to love art and believe in its power to crack open the world. <br></br>

      Meet Dany Pen: artist. Meet the stark, photographic installations of her family and other Cambodian Khmer Rouge survivors that won her a place in Bermuda’s 2012 Biennale. Find out more about her childhood in Toronto’s Regent Park, and how and why she creates art that acts as umbilical cords to her community and family, art that thickens and pulses with empathy and relatedness, always questioning what it takes to maintain – or even achieve – a sense of self amidst disconnection.<br></br>

      <h3>Gumbase </h3>  
      <h4><small>THE INNOVATIE HOMEGROWN GENRE fusing traditional gombey drums with cutting edge electronic production </small></h4>

      <article> 
      The response they received from the first round was encouraging, and pushed them to produce better tracks. Simmons says: “It wasn’t about just doing one track each. It’s about creating a movement, so people can be inspired to embrace Bermudian culture with new age music. There are not many people embracing Bermudian culture in music. It’s people embracing other cultures, or what [they] see on TV." <br></br>

      Simmons acknowledges the work of his predecessors: he knows, for instance, that in 2010 Shine Hayward released Saxy Drummer Boy a Christmas single featuring saxophone atop Pickles Spence Gombey Troupe beats. But the tracks are as different as, say, Kenny G and Skrillex.  “The genre that we’re working on now, it needs to be something more than just the same old. It needs to be something unique in its own entirety, have its own growth to it, similar to house or garage.”

      Gumbase has a sibling project, the The Gombey Beat Initiative. In Kofi’s words, the Facebook page aims to “celebrate, understand, learn and preserve the intricate and driving drum rhythms that give life to the Bermudian Gombey dance tradition.” So far, he’s posted pictures of his handmade gombey headdress in progress, links to folk-life literature and videos of Dominican Guloyas, Montserrat Masqueraders, and the Frevo of Brazil - global dance traditions that bear strong similarities to our gombey.
